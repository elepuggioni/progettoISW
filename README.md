# Scrumboard
This is a university group project created by @steena5, @Fransiscu and @elepuggioni for our "Ingegneria del Software" (= Software Engineering) course.

A Scrumboards is a tool to help visualize work progress and assign tasks to members of a team in an agile work environment.

This application allows users to create and manage their Scrumboards. The user can customize the board by dividing it into columns. 
The user can create and manage cards, each representing a task with a title, description, deadline, that can be put in columns inside the scrumboard and assigned to a member to complete.
There are some additional features, like a burndown view.

This application is written in python with the Django framework and a sqlite database.

While working on this project, we used a scrumboard on Trello to manage our work to simulate an agile work environment.
